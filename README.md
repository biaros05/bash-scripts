## Labs
This repository is a combination of all the scripts i have written in linux bash. Here is a rundown of all the files in which i have organized these scripts:
### Publish and back up files
In this folder, the scripts i have written are:
- backup.sh: backs up all the files that begin with lab in a back up file and creates a link to this file.
- start-web-project.sh: this script copies the skeleton file to start a website into your current directory
- publish.sh: changes the permissions of the files in your current folder and changes the permissions, as well as moves them to the public_html directory for publishing.

- readargs.sh: does the same as the previous, however takes input
